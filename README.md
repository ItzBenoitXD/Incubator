<p align="center">Pterodactyl egg discovery, <b>simplified</b>.</p><br><br>


**What is Incubator?**\
Incubator is a simple way to download non-standard eggs for the Pterodactyl panel through the [Incubator website](https://incubator.prpl.wtf).
It aims to be the replacement for other Pterodactyl egg collections and is hosted on Pages.

**Why Incubator?**\
I've (prplwtf) created Incubator in response to the `parkervcp/eggs` repository being transferred to `pelican-eggs/eggs`.
According to Pelican's FAQ, they plan to make eggs use YAML instead of JSON, which would make them slowly unusable on the Pterodactyl panel.

**Where can I find/download eggs?**\
You can either find/download eggs on [Incubator](https://incubator.prpl.wtf) or by browsing the [`/repository`](/repository) folder.
